## Notice: 
**We are no longer offering or building our testing program. Thank you to our collaborators for their hard work and dedication. Although we are closing up shop, our project has had a lasting impact on fighting the pandemic. We have, with other anti-pandemic activism groups, alerted US federal COVID-19 task force of testing capacity in academic and CORE labs and leading to temporarily lifted restrictions on testing. Our research has helped lead to the approval and use of group testing for high through-put and turn around testing. We are proud to have consulted for: CDC, Medical University of South Carolina, Vanderbilt University, Institute for Immunology and Infectious Diseases (Western Australia), NFL, SpaceX.**

**We hope this webpage can be used as a reference for future testing programs. Please cite any documents or presentations on the website if you use them. If you have questions please email cassidy.mentus@gmail.com**


We provide a streamlined system for COVID-19 testing using the most sensitive RNA-based assay found in academic and CORE research labs, Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR).  Our system is engineered to solve the problem of testing asymptomatic populations accurately, frequently.  
	The world is in unique and unprecedented times.  We understand that your needs as a business or community are unique and evolving. We will help craft a customized strategy that fits your needs and can adapt as circumstances require. Our main purpose is to help your organization develop a custom-tailored strategy that balances your unique needs with respect to key components of testing program design:

1. Throughput-How many tests that can be processed in a given amount of time.
2. Sensitivity/accuracy-Not all tests are created equal. 
3. Predictable result delivery-If labs results are not timely the information may not be useful. Lab and health systems are stressed.  Large clinical diagnostics companies are not always meeting timing demands. 
4. Cost/Resource Utilization: Our group/pool testing strategy can help drive efficiency in this regard. 
5. Time savings- After being shipped overnight or same-day, tests are immediately carried out. The same lab personnel testing your sample uses our system to notify you about results as they are read off the machine. Unnecessary steps are eliminated.

## How Do We Achieve These Goals?
* Specimen tracking from collection to result delivery utilizing our customizable HIPAA compliant software system
* Ease and comfort of self-administered saliva sample collection: Minimizes need for additional collection sites and staffing. 
* We have partnered with several of the most innovative medical center core molecular biology labs in the country to deliver these lab testing services. 
* We have partnered with BioRad Inc. to deliver the highest sensitivity PCR system in the world for the most sensitive results available.
